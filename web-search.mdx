### **1. Enable Web Search**

Make sure the toggle at the top is switched **on** to activate the web lookup.

### **2. Set Location**

Select the region you’d like to restrict the search to. For example, choose **United States** to prioritize results from US-based sources.

### **3. Choose Number of Results**

Use the slider to set how many matching results you’d like returned per query (e.g., 1 to 5).

### **4. Configure Search Query**

Choose which product attributes to search for and whether they should be exact matches.

| **Attribute**    | **Strict Match?** | **Description**                                |
| :--------------- | :---------------- | :--------------------------------------------- |
| **Product Name** | ⬜                 | Searches by name, not enforced strictly        |
| **SKU**          | ☑️                | Forces exact match on catalog/SKU for accuracy |
| **Manufacturer** | ⬜                 | Used for context but not matched strictly      |

### **5. Preview Your Search**

At the bottom, you’ll see the **Preview Search Query** string. This is the actual query being sent to the web. It helps confirm that all important fields are included correctly.

### **6. Site Filters (Optional)**

Restrict or exclude specific websites from being used in results.

- **Only Include**: Limit results to approved domains (e.g., brand or manufacturer websites)
- **Exclude**: Block results from certain domains (e.g., [ebay.com](http://ebay.com) or direct competitor websites)

### **7. Site Filters (Optional)**

Apply additional filtering just for **image-based sources**.

- **Enable Image Source Filters**: Toggle this **on** to restrict sources used for product images.
- Works the same way as site filters—choose **Only Include** or **Exclude** specific image sites.
