### **1. Creating a Sheet**

Click **\+ Create** at the top of the Sheets dashboard. You can start from:

- **Blank Sheet** – A fresh sheet with default settings.
- **Shopify Template** – Preloaded with Shopify-compatible fields.
- **Upload CSV** – Import your own data file to generate a sheet.
- **Use Pinned Sheet** – Clone the structure from a previously pinned sheet.

Give your sheet a name and click **Create Sheet** to get started.

### **2. Pinning or Duplicating a Sheet**

From the sheet list:

- Click the **•••** menu on any sheet.
- Choose **Pin** to mark it for reuse in the future.
- Use **Duplicate** to make an exact copy, including attributes.

Pinned sheets are especially useful for maintaining consistent structure across projects.

### **3. How Sheets Work**

Each sheet is a **self-contained workspace** that includes:

- A list of products (rows)
- A customizable set of attributes (columns)

Sheets do not share data or configurations with each other, allowing you to run multiple projects independently.
