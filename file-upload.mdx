### **Step 1: Upload your CSV**

- Click the **Upload** button at the top of the screen.
- Drag and drop your CSV file into the upload area, or click to browse and select it.
- File size must be under **10MB**.

### **Step 2: Review & Confirm Column Mapping**

- Once uploaded, you’ll be taken to the **Map** screen.
- Column headers from your file are automatically mapped to the system fields.
- **Double-check** each field to ensure the mappings are correct:
  - Product Root ID → Primary ID
  - Product Name → Product Name
  - Manufacturer → Manufacturer Name
  - Catalog Number → Manufacturer Part Number

If a column is incorrectly mapped, you can manually adjust it using the dropdowns.

<Warning>
  If any fields are left unmapped, they will still be stored as raw input for AI enrichment. 

  However, dropped fields will be excluded entirely from the system.

  Make sure to review all mappings before finalizing your upload.
</Warning>

### **Step 3: Finalize Upload**

- Click the **Upload** button in the bottom-right to complete the import.
