### **1. Enable Data Validation**

Make sure the **“Data Validation”** option is checked to activate this feature. This ensures your configured rules are applied during enrichment or review.

### **2. Set Up Validation Rules**

Validation rules define how your product data should be checked. These rules act as quality controls to catch mismatches, missing values, or formatting issues.

#### **For Each Rule:**

- **Display Name:** Give your rule a clear, descriptive name (e.g., “Image Check”, “Description Format Rule”).
- **Rule (Text Field):** Describe the validation condition in plain language. Use specific instructions such as:
  - “Ensure text attributes align with the product name and images.”
  - “Flag if warranty is missing for electronics.”
  - “Check that material includes ‘wood’ if category is Furniture.”

<Tip>
  Use / to insert specific attributes into your rule (e.g., /Material, /Product Name). These will dynamically reference values from your data.
</Tip>

### **3. Add More Rules**

Click **\+ Add Rule** to create additional validation checks. You can define as many as needed for your use case.

### **Best Practices**

- Be specific: Avoid vague rules. Use terms like “must include”, “cannot be empty”, or “should match”.
- Use attributes: Refer to actual field names using / to make the rules dynamic.
